Intended to workaround an issue with slot counts as a result of an incompatibility with Silby Overhaul Beta12 and YAML 0.9.1

It is janky but it instead adjusts the equipment properties using the "SlotFiller" properties to take up the intended slots.
The only gyro not temporarily corrected is the XXL as it is internally trying to take more slots than exist and cannot be adjusted.
