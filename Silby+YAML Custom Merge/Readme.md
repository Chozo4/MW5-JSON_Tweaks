Current as of Silby Overhaul Beta12 and YAML 0.9.1<br><br>

These tweaks are a merge of the features of both mods. Many of the mech quirks were overall simplistic (such as all hero mechs getting a heat output reduction) and overwrote the original quirks from YAML (such as hero mechs having customized quirks for the chassis itself or the urbie having an armour boost). As a result I have merged both into one to combine the quirks of both worlds (within reason) with a couple adjustments of my own.<br><br>Simply overwrite the json files with these in the 'resources' folder of Silby's overhaul.<br><br>These also currently contain the partial temporary workarounds for the slot issue with both gyros' and cockpits.
